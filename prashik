To host a basic website using an Amazon EC2 instance on AWS, you can follow these steps to create a simple script:

Launch an EC2 Instance: Use AWS Management Console to launch an EC2 instance with an appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI) like Amazon Linux.

Configure Security Group: In the EC2 dashboard, create a new security group that allows incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 22 (SSH) from your IP address or any desired source.

Connect to EC2 Instance: Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance using your key pair.

Update System Packages: Run the following commands to update system packages and install necessary utilities:

$ sudo yum update -y
$ sudo yum install -y httpd

To start the Apache Server

$ systemctl  start httpd
$ systemctl enable httpd

Create Website Directory: Create a directory to store your website files, for example:

$ sudo mkdir /var/www/html/mywebsite

Remember that this script is a basic setup for hosting a simple static website.
